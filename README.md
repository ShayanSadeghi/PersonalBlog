# personal Blog

It is a personal blog and have some sections instead of blog posts such as:

- Project sections

- About section

- Skills section

- Personal Data

- Contact form

So in addition to having a blog, you can also introduce yourself and recieve messages from your contacts.
This project using MySQL database and Next.js framework and I also use Wordpress to manage my blog posts.
